TSA apparently finds an "impossible" solution: message 2 below is sent from the PLAYER address, when it should be sent from the OWNER address (otherwise the transaction would fail). It turns out that check_owner function does not have the "impure" modifier, which means that FunC removes it in the compiled bytecode. Hence, the owner check is actually not needed, which means that the player CAN send the "change owner" message (message to below).
